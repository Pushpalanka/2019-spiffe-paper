\subsection{Wireless algorithm description}\label{appdx-alg}

The following is a brief overview of three wireless algorithms 
introduced in Section~\ref{sec-wireless-alg}, and an 
explanation of how we adapted them to run on the Sensibility 
testbed. All three algorithms are implemented at the WiFi sender. 

\textbf{RapidSample algorithm (mobile).} If a packet fails to get an
acknowledgment, RapidSample switches to a lower sending rate and
records the time of the failure. After achieving success at the target rate for a short
period of time (30ms in our implementation), the sender samples a
higher rate and switches to it if it is the highest rate and has not
failed in the recent past (50ms in our case).

\textbf{SampleRate algorithm (stationary).} SampleRate changes its
sending rate when it experiences four successive failures. The rate it
switches to is selected from a set of rates that have been
periodically sampled. Over the past 10s, if the sampled rate
exhibits better performance (lower packet loss and lower transmission time)
than the current rate, SampleRate switches to this rate.

\textbf{Hint-aware adaptation algorithm (hybrid).} This algorithm
%is implemented at the sender and 
uses RapidSample for data
transmission when the receiver is mobile, but uses SampleRate
when the receiver is stationary. It relies on movement hints generated by the
movement detection algorithm that are piggy-backed on acknowledgement packets
to the sender and are interpreted at the sender
as a signal to switch between the mobile and stationary algorithms. At 
the receiver, we use a smartphone accelerometer to detect 
movement.
